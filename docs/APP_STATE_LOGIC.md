## üîÅ Side Effects (useEffect in App.tsx)

Zustand actions and state are used inside effects to coordinate data fetching and UI updates.

### Effect 1 ‚Äî `[ currentManifest, selectedImageIndex ]`
Sets the current canvasId in the store when the manifest or image index changes.

### Effect 2 ‚Äî `[ currentManifest, canvasId, selectedManifestIndex, manifestUrls ]`
Fetches annotations for the current canvas and manifest using a store action.

### Effect 3 ‚Äî `[ annotations, pendingAnnotationId, viewerReady ]`
Selects an annotation by ID after the viewer is ready, updating store state.

### Effect 4 ‚Äî `[ iiifContentUrl ]`
Loads the initial manifest/collection when the IIIF content URL changes, using a store action.

### Effect 5 ‚Äî `[ currentManifest, currentCollection ]`
Updates autocomplete and search URLs in the store when manifest or collection changes.

### Effect 6 ‚Äî `[ iiifContentUrl, iiifContentUrlFromParams ]`
Shows the URL dialog if no IIIF content URL is set.

## üß≠ Core Logic Functions (Now Store Actions)

- `handleManifestUpdate(firstManifest, manifestUrls, total, collection)` ‚Äî Updates manifest, collection, and related metadata state in the store.
- `fetchManifestByIndex(index)` ‚Äî Loads a manifest by its index using a store action.
- `handleSearch(query)` ‚Äî Performs a content search and updates search results in the store.
- `handleSearchResultClick(canvasTarget, manifestId?, searchResultId?)` ‚Äî Navigates to a search result and selects the relevant annotation via the store.
- `handleViewerReady()` ‚Äî Sets viewerReady to true in the store when the image viewer is ready.
- `handleUrlSubmit(event)` ‚Äî Handles submission of a new IIIF content URL, updating store state.

---

## üß© Component Interaction

- **Header**: Receives navigation, search, and language state/handlers from the store.
- **LeftPanel**: Receives manifest and collection metadata from the store.
- **MiddlePanel**: Receives image/canvas data and selected annotation from the store.
- **RightPanel**: Receives annotations, search results, and active tab state from the store.
- **UrlDialog**: Shown when no IIIF content URL is set (store-driven).
- **ErrorDialog**: Shown when an error occurs (store-driven).

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling & User Flow

- If an error occurs (e.g., failed manifest load), the app displays an error dialog and may prompt for a new IIIF URL (store-driven).
- If no IIIF content URL is set, the app shows the URL input dialog (store-driven).
